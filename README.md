# hisBot

hisBot is an educational robot and hopefully able to teach basics.
I'm using a pretty cheap kit and hope code can be used for parent\child and hobbyists projects, 
I'm intentionally using a cheap but sturdy kit.  STEM and eduction should be accessible to all.

It's starts at a two motor non-self balanacing robot kit.
Then 4 wheel and then a mecaNum robot.

Sensors that are relavent to my needs will be visited.
But it is written in a way that you can use what you want.

Things to do:
//I only have esp32,esp8266, rp2040 and rp2053 chips

*RTOS for supported chips
* write tutorials
* refine language so easy for anyone
* take constructive criticism and use it to refine and upgrade access
* More integrations, such as Micropython,ROS, https://www.roboticslibrary.org/, and platformIO
* *Home Assistant intergration

* @Dedication:  Shinigami

Shinigami he's my cat who was hit by a car.  I had been working on a laserlight cat toy at the time.
In dedication to him.  He just walked up and said (in cat language):  "Wanna be friends" and never left, we just knew.
He was a good cat colony leader, he made sure I fed everybody.
Truly a cool cat.  This project (at least my hope), will emody his spirit.
